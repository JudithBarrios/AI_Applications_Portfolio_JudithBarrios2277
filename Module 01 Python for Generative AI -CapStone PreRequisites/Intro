1.    Introduction: My First Encounter with AI as a “General-Purpose Technology “

Starting this capstone course, I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect, but the phrase “general-purpose technology” caught my attention right away, it made me think about how the internet completely changed everything about how we communicate, work, and live. Now we are apparently at another one of those moments with AI. 

2.    Description of Experience or Topic:

2.1 Breaking Down the Technical Landscape

The course overview laid out four main areas we’ll be covering, deep learning, natural language processing, machine learning, and those GPT models that are popular today. What hit me was realizing how these aren’t just abstract concepts anymore, but they’re actively reshaping industries I interact with daily, from healthcare to education. Like it’s one thing to hear about AI in the news, and it’s another thing to understand that I’m about to learn how to actually build with these tools.

 

2.2 Discovering What LLMs can Actually Do 

The breakdown of LLM capabilities was very interesting, I knew how advanced AI is that it can write things for you, but I didn’t know it could translate, make summaries, answer questions, finish sentences, etc. It made me realize how much broader this technology is than I first thought, the examples showing writing, reading, and chatting uses were particularly helpful also. Seeing real scenarios like suggesting platform names, analyzing complaints, and handling customer service interactions made these abilities feel real and useful rather than just theoretical.

 

2.3 Web vs App: More Than Just Interface Differences 

The difference between web-based platforms like ChatGPT and Bard versus software-based applications got me thinking about how we’ll actually interact with AI moving forward. It’s not just about where you access the technology, but how it fits into existing work processes and systems. This seems like it’ll be important for anyone trying to put AI solutions to work professionally.

 

3.    Personal Reflection

3.1The Business Case That Makes Sense 

When the slides covered organizational benefits, it was really good to look at, because the idea that companies can take all their stored knowledge and make it accessible through simple conversations feels like a huge win, instead of looking through documents or waiting for expert availability, employees could potentially get answers right away. From an individual perspective, the promise of processing huge amounts of information quickly and improving decision-making speed addresses real challenges I’ve experienced in previous work. There’s something appealing about having AI as a thinking partner rather than just an automation tool.

 

3.2Prompt Engineering: The Skill I didn’t Know I’d Need 

The section on prompt engineerings future was also interesting because it highlighted a skill set that barely existed a few years ago. The prediction of more advanced techniques, better integration with other tools, and user friendly interfaces suggests we’re still in the early stages, learning this now feels like getting in on the ground floor of something that’s about to become essential.

 

3.3 Traditional AI vs Generative AI: Understanding the Shift

The comparison table really drove home how generative AI represents a big shift rather than just an upgrade. Traditional AI excels at sorting and predicting, tasks with clear right answers, and Generative AI tackles creative challenges, producing new content based on learned patterns. We’re not replacing one with the other, we are expanding what’s possible.

 

4.    Discussion of improvement and learning

 My Approach to This Learning Experience 

Going into this course, I want to balance technical skill development with critical thinking about putting it to use. I’m curious about the ethical considerations, the limits we need to acknowledge, and how to use these tools responsibly. There’s exciting potential, but also real responsibility that comes with understanding how to shape AI interactions, l’m particularly interested in exploring how Python lets us work with these systems programmatically rather than just through chat interfaces. That seems like where the real important lies for building custom solutions. 

 

5.    Conclusion

What This Means Moving Forward 

Starting this capstone feels like stepping into a field that’s defining itself in real time , the technology is advancing rapidly, the applications are expanding daily, and the skills we develop here will likely be relevant far beyond this course. My goal is to emerge not just with technical skills, but with genuine understanding of how to thoughtfully integrate these tools into meaningful work. The comparison between AI and generative AI showed me we’re not just learning about technology, we’re learning about a new way to approach creative and analytical challenges . These are my honest first impressions as I begin this deep dive into generative AI. I expect my understanding will change significantly as we move through the practical applications and coding exercises ahead.
